I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering](http://www.csie.ndhu.edu.tw/)at [National Dong Hwa University](http://www.ndhu.edu.tw/).  

From Aug 2018 - Jan 2023, I was an Project Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering](http://www.ncyn.edu.tw/csie/) at [National Chiayi University](http://www.ncyn.edu.tw/), where I taught several courses, such as "Fundamentals of Programming", "Introduction to Machine learning", "Introduction to Big Data Analysis", "Machine Learning", "Social Networks and Recommender Systems", and "Deep Learning." 

From Aug 2017 - Jul 2018, I was an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the [Department of Information and Learning Technology](http://ilt.nutn.edu.tw/) at [National University of Tainan](http://www.nutn.edu.tw/index.htm), where I taught two courses "Digital Publishing and Archiving" and "Software Engineering." From Feb 2018 - Jun 2018, I was a Project Employee in Artificial Intelligence Team of [Medical Device Innovation Center](http://mdic.ncku.edu.tw/cht/) at [National Cheng Kung University](http://web.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=zh-tw).  

From Jan 2017 - Jul 2017, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Geomatics](http://www.geomatics.ncku.edu.tw/) at [National Cheng Kung University](http://web.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=zh-tw). From Apr 2014 - Dec 2016, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering](http://www.csie.ncku.edu.tw/ncku_csie/) at [National Cheng Kung University](http://web.ncku.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=zh-tw).  

I received my Ph.D. in 2014 from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/), advised by [Jane Yung-jen Hsu](https://iagentntu.github.io/professor/Jane).
